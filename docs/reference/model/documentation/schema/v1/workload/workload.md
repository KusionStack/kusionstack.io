## Schemas

### Job

Job is a kind of workload profile that describes how to run your application code. This is typically used for tasks that take from a few seconds to a few days to complete.

#### Attributes

**annotations**

`{str:str}`

Annotations are key/value pairs that attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to the workload.

**containers** *required*

`{str:Container}`

Containers defines the templates of containers to be ran.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers

**labels**

`{str:str}`

Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to the workload.

**replicas** *required*

`int`

Number of container replicas based on this configuration that should be ran.

**schedule** *required*

`str`

**secrets**

`{str:Secret}`

### Service

Service is a kind of workload profile that describes how to run your application code. This is typically used for long-running web applications that should "never" go down, and handle short-lived latency-sensitive web requests, or events.

#### Attributes

**annotations**

`{str:str}`

Annotations are key/value pairs that attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to the workload.

**containers** *required*

`{str:Container}`

Containers defines the templates of containers to be ran.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers

**labels**

`{str:str}`

Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to the workload.

**ports** *required*

`[Port]`

The list of ports of the Service should get exposed.

**replicas** *required*

`int`

Number of container replicas based on this configuration that should be ran.

**secrets**

`{str:Secret}`

**type** *required*

`"Deployment" | "CollaSet"`

Type represents the type of workload used by this Service. Currently, it supports several
types, including Deployment and CollaSet.

### WorkloadBase

WorkloadBase defines set of attributes shared by different workload profile, e.g Service and Job. You can inherit this Schema to reuse these common attributes.

#### Attributes

**annotations**

`{str:str}`

Annotations are key/value pairs that attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to the workload.

**containers** *required*

`{str:Container}`

Containers defines the templates of containers to be ran.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers

**labels**

`{str:str}`

Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to the workload.

**replicas** *required*

`int`

Number of container replicas based on this configuration that should be ran.

**secrets**

`{str:Secret}`
