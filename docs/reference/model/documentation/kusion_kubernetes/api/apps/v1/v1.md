## Schemas

### DaemonSet

DaemonSet represents the configuration of a daemon set.

#### Attributes

**apiVersion** *required* *readOnly*

`"apps/v1"`

APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

**kind** *required* *readOnly*

`"DaemonSet"`

Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

**metadata**

`ObjectMeta`

The desired behavior of this daemon set. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

### DaemonSetSpec

DaemonSetSpec is the specification of a daemon set.

#### Attributes

**minReadySeconds**

`int`

The minimum number of seconds for which a newly created DaemonSet pod should be ready without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available. Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready).

**paused**

`bool`

Indicates that the deployment is paused.

**progressDeadlineSeconds**

`int`

The maximum time in seconds for a deployment to make progress before it is considered to be failed.

Number of desired pods. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 1.

**revisionHistoryLimit**

`int`

The number of old ReplicaSets to retain to allow rollback. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 10.

**selector** *required*

Label selector for pods. Existing ReplicaSets whose pods are selected by this will be the ones affected by this deployment. It must match the pod template&#39;s labels.

**strategy**

`DeploymentStrategy`

The deployment strategy to use to replace existing pods with new ones.

**template** *required*

`PodTemplateSpec`

Template describes the pods that will be created.

### DeploymentStrategy

DeploymentStrategy describes how to replace existing pods with new ones.

#### Attributes

**rollingUpdate**

`RollingUpdateDeployment`

Rolling update config params. Present only if DeploymentStrategyType = RollingUpdate.

**type**

`str`

### RollingUpdateDaemonSet

Spec to control the desired behavior of daemon set rolling update.

#### Attributes

**maxSurge**

`int | str`

The maximum number of nodes with an existing available DaemonSet pod that can have an updated DaemonSet pod during during an update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%). This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0. Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1. Default value is 0. Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled) can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted. The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits. Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may cause evictions during disruption. This is beta field and enabled/disabled by DaemonSetUpdateSurge feature gate.

**maxUnavailable**

`int | str`

The maximum number of DaemonSet pods that can be unavailable during the update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of total number of DaemonSet pods at the start of the update (ex: 10%). Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. This cannot be 0 if MaxSurge is 0 Default value is 1. Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled) can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available, it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least 70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during the update.

### RollingUpdateDeployment

Spec to control the desired behavior of rolling update.

#### Attributes

**maxSurge**

`int | str`

The maximum number of pods that can be scheduled above the desired number of pods. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%). This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0. Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. Defaults to 25%. Example: when this is set to 30%, the new ReplicaSet can be scaled up immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the total number of old and new pods do not exceed 130% of desired pods. Once old pods have been killed, new ReplicaSet can be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of pods running at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired pods.

**maxUnavailable**

`int | str`

The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%). Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down. This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0. Defaults to 25%. Example: when this is set to 30%, the old ReplicaSet can be scaled down to 70% of desired pods immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old ReplicaSet can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new ReplicaSet, ensuring that the total number of pods available at all times during the update is at least 70% of desired pods.

### RollingUpdateStatefulSetStrategy

RollingUpdateStatefulSetStrategy is used to communicate parameter for RollingUpdateStatefulSetStrategyType.

#### Attributes

**partition**

`int`

Partition indicates the ordinal at which the StatefulSet should be partitioned. Default value is 0.

### StatefulSet

StatefulSet represents a set of pods with consistent identities. Identities are defined as: - Network: A single stable DNS and hostname. - Storage: As many VolumeClaims as requested.The StatefulSet guarantees that a given network identity will always map to the same storage identity.

#### Attributes

**apiVersion** *required* *readOnly*

`"apps/v1"`

**kind** *required* *readOnly*

`"StatefulSet"`

**metadata**

`ObjectMeta`

**spec**

`StatefulSetSpec`

### StatefulSetSpec

A StatefulSetSpec is the specification of a StatefulSet.

#### Attributes

**minReadySeconds**

`int`

Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready without any of its container crashing for it to be considered available. Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready) This is an alpha field and requires enabling StatefulSetMinReadySeconds feature gate.

**podManagementPolicy**

`str`

podManagementPolicy controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is `OrderedReady`, where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy is `Parallel` which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once.

**replicas**

`int`

replicas is the desired number of replicas of the given Template. These are replicas in the sense that they are instantiations of the same Template, but individual replicas also have a consistent identity. If unspecified, defaults to 1.

**revisionHistoryLimit**

`int`

revisionHistoryLimit is the maximum number of revisions that will be maintained in the StatefulSet&#39;s revision history. The revision history consists of all revisions not represented by a currently applied StatefulSetSpec version. The default value is 10.

**selector** *required*

`LabelSelector`

selector is a label query over pods that should match the replica count. It must match the pod template&#39;s labels. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors

**serviceName** *required*

`str`

serviceName is the name of the service that governs this StatefulSet. This service must exist before the StatefulSet, and is responsible for the network identity of the set. Pods get DNS/hostnames that follow the pattern: pod-specific-string.serviceName.default.svc.cluster.local where &#34;pod-specific-string&#34; is managed by the StatefulSet controller.

**template** *required*

`PodTemplateSpec`

template is the object that describes the pod that will be created if insufficient replicas are detected. Each pod stamped out by the StatefulSet will fulfill this Template, but have a unique identity from the rest of the StatefulSet.

**updateStrategy**

`StatefulSetUpdateStrategy`

updateStrategy indicates the StatefulSetUpdateStrategy that will be employed to update Pods in the StatefulSet when a revision is made to Template.

**volumeClaimTemplates**

`[PersistentVolumeClaim]`

volumeClaimTemplates is a list of claims that pods are allowed to reference. The StatefulSet controller is responsible for mapping network identities to claims in a way that maintains the identity of a pod. Every claim in this list must have at least one matching (by name) volumeMount in one container in the template. A claim in this list takes precedence over any volumes in the template, with the same name.

### StatefulSetUpdateStrategy

StatefulSetUpdateStrategy indicates the strategy that the StatefulSet controller will use to perform updates. It includes any additional parameters necessary to perform the update for the indicated strategy.

#### Attributes

**rollingUpdate**

`RollingUpdateStatefulSetStrategy`

RollingUpdate is used to communicate parameters when Type is RollingUpdateStatefulSetStrategyType.

**type**

`str`
