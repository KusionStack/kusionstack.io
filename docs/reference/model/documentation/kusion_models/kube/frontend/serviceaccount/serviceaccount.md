## Schemas

### ServiceAccount

A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod. ServiceAccount binds together: - a name, understood by users, and perhaps by peripheral systems, for an identity - a principal that can be authenticated and authorized - a set of secrets More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authentication-resources/service-account-v1/#ServiceAccount

#### Attributes

**annotations**

`{str:str}`

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a
resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve
arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved
when modifying objects.

**imagePullSecrets**

`[{str:str}]`

ImagePullSecrets is a list of references to secrets in the same namespace to use for pulling any images in pods that reference this ServiceAccount.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod

**labels**

`{str:str}`

Labels is a map of string keys and values that can be used to
organize and categorize (scope and select) objects.
May match selectors of replication controllers and services.
More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels

**name**

`str`

The name of the resource.
Name must be unique within a namespace. It&#39;s required when creating
resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the
generation of an appropriate name automatically.
Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration
definition. Cannot be updated. More info:
http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

**namespace**

`str`

Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread
across multiple teams, or projects.
For clusters with a few to tens of users, you should not need to create
or think about namespaces at all. Start using namespaces when you need the features they provide.
