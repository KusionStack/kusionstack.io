## Schemas

### Service

Service are Kubernetes objects which partition a single Kubernetes cluster into multiple virtual clusters. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/service-resources/service-v1/#Service

#### Attributes

**annotations**

`{str:str}`

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a
resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve
arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved
when modifying objects.
More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

**clusterIP**

`str`

clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assigned randomly by the master.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies

**externalIPs**

`[str]`

externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will also accept traffic for this service.

**externalName**

`str`

externalName is the external reference that discovery mechanisms will return as an alias for this service (e.g. a DNS CNAME record).

**externalTrafficPolicy**

`str`

externalTrafficPolicy denotes if this Service desires to route external traffic to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints.

**healthCheckNodePort**

`int`

healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service.

**ipFamilyPolicy**

`str`

ipFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required by this Service, and is gated by the &#34;IPv6DualStack&#34; feature gate.

**labels**

`{str:str}`

Labels is a map of string keys and values that can be used to
organize and categorize (scope and select) objects.
May match selectors of replication controllers and services.
More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels

**loadBalancerIP**

`str`

Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer LoadBalancer will get created with the IP specified in this field.

**loadBalancerSourceRanges**

`[str]`

If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic through the cloud-provider load-balancer will be restricted to the specified client IPs.
This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/

**name**

`str`

The name of the resource.
Name must be unique within a namespace. It&#39;s required when creating
resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the
generation of an appropriate name automatically.
Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration
definition. Cannot be updated. More info:
http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

**namespace**

`str`

Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread
across multiple teams, or projects.
For clusters with a few to tens of users, you should not need to create
or think about namespaces at all. Start using namespaces when you need the features they provide.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/

**ports**

`[ServicePort]`

The list of ports that are exposed by this service.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies

**publishNotReadyAddresses**

`bool`

publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints for this Service should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready.

**selector**

`{str:str}`

Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching this selector.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/

**sessionAffinity**

`str`

Supports &#34;ClientIP&#34; and &#34;None&#34;. Used to maintain session affinity.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies

**sessionAffinityConfig**

`{str:}`

sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations of session affinity.

**type**

`str`

determines how the Service is exposed.
