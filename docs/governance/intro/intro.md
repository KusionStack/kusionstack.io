# Community

Welcome to the [KusionStack](/docs/user_docs/intro/kusion-intro) open source community, everyone's participation is the driving force for the healthy growth of all open source projects! There are many ways to participate in open source. Everyone can create Issues or fix bugs, improve documentation or modify code by submitting PR (Pull Request), or open new feature discussions by submitting KEP, or share stories about the process of evangelism and use of Kusion with surrounding friends.
