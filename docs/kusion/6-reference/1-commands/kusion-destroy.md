# kusion destroy

Destroy resources within the stack.

### Synopsis

Destroy resources within the stack.

 Please note that the destroy command does NOT perform resource version checks. Therefore, if someone submits an update to a resource at the same time you execute a destroy command, their update will be lost along with the rest of the resource.
