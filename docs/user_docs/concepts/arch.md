# Architecture
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KusionStack/kusion/main/docs/arch.png)


KusionStack includes three core components:

- [KCL](https://github.com/KusionStack/KCLVM): A constraint-based record & functional language used in configuration and policy scenarios.
- [Konfig](https://github.com/KusionStack/konfig): A mono-codespace for programmable app configuration and shared schemas.
- [Kusion](https://github.com/KusionStack/kusion): The engine to deliver intentions to clouds.
  
The image above illustrates the workflow of KusionStack and how it works. In the next section, we will describe each of these components in detail.
