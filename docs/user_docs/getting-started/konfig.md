# Kusion Model Library

Kusion model library, is a preset configuration model described by KCL. It provides users with out-of-the-box, highly abstract configuration interfaces. The original starting point of the model library is to improve the efficiency and experience of YAML users. We hope to simplify the writing of user-side configuration code by abstracting and encapsulating the model with more complex code into a unified model.

## 1. Directory

First clone the Kusion model library: `git clone git@github.com:KusionStack/Konfig.git`。

The overall structure of the Config configuration library is as follows:

```bash
.
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── appops # App Ops
│   ├── guestbook-frontend
│   ├── http-echo
│   └── nginx-example
├── base                # Kusion Models
│   ├── examples        # Kusion Model Examples
│   │   ├── monitoring  # monitoring example
│   │   ├── native      # Kubernetes example
│   │   └── server
│   └── pkg
│       ├── kusion_kubernetes   # Kubernetes low level models
│       ├── kusion_models       # core models
│       └── kusion_prometheus   # Prometheus low level models
├── hack                # utils script
└── kcl.mod             # kcl module file
```

## 2. Test the Konfig

After the Kusion tool is installed, execute the `make check-all` test (refer to Project & Stack ), or execute the `make check-http-echo` test `appops/http-echo` application.

If you need to test the dev version of the `appops/http-echo` application , you can enter the `appops/http-echo/dev` directory to execute the `kusion compile` command (or through a lower-level `kcl -Y kcl.yaml ./ci-test/settings.yaml` command), and the output file is in the `appops/http-echo/dev/ci-test/stdout.golden.yaml` file .

## 3. Add app

In [Quick Start/Usecase](/docs/user_docs/getting-started/usecase) we have shown how to quickly add an application (see [Project & Stack](/docs/user_docs/concepts/project-stack)).

## 4. Konfig Architecture

The reason why a large warehouse is used to manage all the IaC configuration codes is that the development subjects of different code packages are different, which will lead to the problems of package management and version management, which leads to the need for the platform side to support the ability of similar compilation platforms. In the big library mode, the business configuration code and basic configuration code are in one big library, so the version dependency management between codes is relatively simple, and the processing on the platform side is relatively simple. It is enough to locate the directory and file of the unique code library, and the code can communicate with each other. Unified management, easy to find, modify and maintain (the big library mode is also the internal practice mode of Google and other leading Internet companies).

The following is the architecture diagram of Konfig:

The core model simplifies the configuration code of front-end users through two-layer abstraction of front-end model and back-end model, and the underlying model is automatically generated by [KCL OpenAPI](/docs/reference/cli/openapi) tool.

More detailed documentation of the model can be found in the Reference [Kusion Model Library](/docs/reference/model).
