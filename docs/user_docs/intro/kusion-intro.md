# KusionStack


## What is KusionStack?

**KusionStack is an open-source cloud-native programmable technology stack!**

KusionStack is a highly flexible programmable technology stack to enable unified app delivery, inspired by the phrase 'Fusion on the Kubernetes', which aims to help enterprises build a config-based and self-service platform based on cloud-native technology for developers. 

To put it simply, KusionStack aims to help developers:

1. **Codify** and **unify** configurations and policies around a modern app delivery along with an OCI image
2. **Organize** application's resources and ensure secure access by **identities** throughout the entire delivery process
3. Streamline app delivers workflow to **Kubernetes** and **clouds** with a dev-friendly experience

Based on the concept of Platform as Code, developers could define the app delivery life cycle with a **unified organized and operate interface**, fully leverage the **hybrid capability of Kubernetes and cloud**, go through the **end-to-end delivery workflow**, and truly achieve the **centralized definition, arbitrary delivery**.

## What can be done with KusionStack?

We have two perspectives to perceive the value of KusionStack.

As an out-of-box product, KusionStack helps to:
+ **Config** your app with an app-centric model above Kubernetes and cloud resources
+ **Deliver** your app with dev-friendly tools and IDE products to Kubernetes and clouds

As an engineering stack, KusionStack helps to:
+ **Build** your apps' abstraction models with the **collaboration** of multiple roles 
+ **Orchestrate** your automation workflow to **hybrid** resources across Kubernetes and clouds
+ **Integrate** into your homegrown or public systems

## KusionStack Highlights

**App-centric**
App is the first-class citizen of KusionStack. KusionStack provides an out-of-the-box **app delivery model** based on best practices and also supports customizing your application models. With the simple application model definition, KusionStack provides sufficient automation support to help developers turn the blueprint into reality.

**Flexible**
Based on the self-developed programming language **KCL**, the powerful engine and a variety of extensible mechanisms, KusionStack provides full flexibility for developers undertaking ops work. KusionStack can meet the needs of individual developers, small teams and large groups with the good scalability and manageability through the standard **project** and **stack** structures. The pure client-side solution also ensures good portability and the rich APIs make it easier to integrate and automate. 

**Collaborative**
In addition to the general advantages of as-code solutions, KusionStack hopes to help to define the application model with the platform team and application team collaboratively. With the **separation of concerns**, different roles could focus on their work based on their knowledge and responsibility. Through such a division of labor, the platform team can better manage the differences and complexities of the platform, and app developers could participate in ops work with less cognitive load.


## KusionStack Composition

KusionStack consists of a series of tools and products. Among them, KCL provides programmability similar to modern programming languages, Kusion turns blueprints into reality with powerful engines and orchestration capabilities, and Konfig holds app delivery models and components. You can choose to use one of them, such as KCL, or use them in combination.

+ [KCL](https://github.com/KusionStack/KCLVM): Configuration and policy programming language for application developers, along with its protocols, toolchains and IDE plugins
+ [Kusion](https://github.com/KusionStack/kusion): Operation engine, toolchains, service, IDE workspace
+ [Konfig](https://github.com/KusionStack/konfig): Shared repository of application models and components, and CI suite for GitOps workflows (such as GitHub Actions suite)

## KusionStack vs. X

KusionStack is a pure client-side programmable technology stack, which aims to define an app-centric delivery model and an end-to-end automation workflow.

**vs. Terraform**

Terraform is a programmable operation product widely used in cloud resource delivery scenarios. It helps operators access different cloud APIs easily with programmable resource blocks, state management, and API providers. Terraform reduces the difficulty of using imperative APIs of various cloud vendors and provides a good declarative operation experience with a concise workflow. 

In contrast, KusionStack attempts to help developers work with an abstract app delivery model and also makes it easier for different roles to collaborate to build and manage the abstraction. KusionStack natively supports scalability, automation, and high performance for enterprise-level requirements. KusionStack works in a Kubernetes-first way and leverages Terraform to manage non-Kubernetes resources.

**vs. Pulumi**

Pulumi is a programmable technology stack that combines a GPL(general purpose language) SDK and the Terraform technology framework. In terms of programming capabilities, Pulumi provides well-designed multi-GPL client SDKs and fully builds a Terraform-like engine and Provider framework.

KusionStack tries to provide a coding method with low noise, low side effects, limited functions, and easy automation and governance, while GPL is overkill and difficult to automate and govern uniformly. In addition, Pulumi helps users write a client-side runtime to access the server, while KusionStack allows users to write runtime-independent config, constraints, and policies, thereby bringing better left-shift stability. From a technical point of view, KusionStack works in a Kubernetes-first way and leverages Terraform to manage non-Kubernetes resources.

**vs. CD systems (eg KubeVela, ArgoCD)**

CD systems are usually sourced in some declarative format and complete automated delivery and configuration drift reconciliation through Pull, Push, or the combination of Pull & Push. The Kusion engine can be regarded as a CD engine implementation in the push mode. If you have adopted a CD system, KusionStack can be integrated with it, such as reconciling KCL code through ArgoCD or writing codify OAM model and running with KubeVela, etc.

**vs. Helm**

The concept of Helm originates from the package management mechanism of the operating system. It is a package management tool based on templated YAML files and supports the execution and management of resources in the package. KusionStack naturally provides a superset of Helm capabilities with the modeled key-value pairs, so that developers can use KusionStack directly as a programable alternative to avoid the pain of writing text templates. For users who have adopted Helm, the stack compilation results in KusionStack can be packaged and used in Helm format.

**vs. OAM**

OAM is a standard, open-source open application model specification. It is mainly used in the cloud-native CD control plane KubeVela and is implemented by cloud-native technology CRD and operator and supports any custom resource as a payload. KusionStack provides an out-of-the-box application model, as well as allows developers to define different app delivery models according to their preferences. KusionStack could also act as a means of implementing the OAM model on the client side as well as be used in combination with KubeVela.

**vs. CrossPlane**

CrossPlane is an open-source cloud-native control plane framework, with its XRM model based on the KRM model, that redefines, reconciles, and manages imperative cloud APIs, fully leveraging the advantages of Kubernetes API extension. KusionStack adopts a lightweight client-side approach to build a unified app delivery model, natively providing better scalability and manageability. KusionStack does not require CRDs and operators installation on the Kubernetes API server which reduces the pressure on the Kubernetes API side in large-scale scenarios. Since KusionStack natively supports full usage of the Kubernetes API server capabilities, it can be used in combination seamlessly with CrossPlane.

**vs. Kubernetes**

Kubernetes is a container scheduling and management runtime widely used around the world, an "operating system" core for containers, and a platform for building platforms. Above the Kubernetes API layer, KusionStack aims to provide app-centric **abstraction** and unified **workspace**, better **user experience** and automation **workflow**, and helps developers build the app delivery model easily and collaboratively.

**vs. App PaaS**

Compared with application delivery products or platforms, KusionStack is a client-side programmable technology stack, which is not a complete App PaaS. KusionStack's products can be used as part of App PaaS, or as the basis for building your App PaaS as a platform engineering solution.


## Development status

KusionStack is at an early stage of open source. We will continue to focus on providing a better and more usable **application delivery model**, supporting **multiple clusters** and more **clouds**, and natively providing **identity** and **resource** management mechanisms.
