title: How to Insight
---

In this section, we will introduce how to gain comprehensive insights into the resources within a cluster using Karpor. You can access the Insight page in various ways and easily toggle between insight pages for different resource groups (such as Cluster, Kind, Namespace). If there are domain-specific cluster resource logical concepts within your current organization, you can even customize resource groups (such as Application, Environment, etc.) by setting rules. We also provide functionality to gain insights into these custom resource groups.

This guide will be entirely operated within the Web UI visualization interface.
