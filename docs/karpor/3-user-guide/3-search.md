title: How to Search
---
Within this section, we will explore how to perform multi-cluster resource searches using Karpor, with this guide being done entirely through the Dashboard.

Karpor support three methods of search:

- **Search by SQL**: Perform resource searches using SQL query language.
- **Search by DSL**: Conduct resource searches through Karpor's Domain Specific Language (DSL).
- **Search by Natural Language**: Using natural language for resource search.

## Search by SQL

Karpor offers a nifty SQL query feature that allows you to search and filter all Kubernetes resources within managed clusters using familiar SQL syntax and provides targeted optimizations and enhancements for multi-cluster resource searches.

SQL is one of the easily accessible skills for practitioners in the software engineering industry, theoretically making the learning curve quite low. As such, this search method is prepared for you! It is particularly well-suited for beginners to Karpor.

Below are the steps to use Search by SQL:

1. **Enter the Search page**: Karpor designs the homepage as the entry point for search, so opening Karpor's Web UI immediately presents you with the search page.

2. **Compose SQL query statements**: Write your query statement using SQL syntax, specifying the cluster name, resource type, conditions, and filters you wish to search for. Additionally, if you enter a keyword and press a space, the search box will pop up with a dropdown with auto-completion, suggesting possible keywords you can type next.

3. **Execute the query**: Click the 'search' button to execute the query and be sent to the search results page. Karpor will return a list of resources that match the SQL query.

4. **Advanced features**: Utilize karpor's built-in advanced SQL syntax, such as sorting, full-text search, etc., to refine your search further. For details, please refer to: [Search Methodology Documentation](../5-references/3-search-methods.md).

## Search by Natural Language

Although the SQL search function Karpor currently offer does not require additional learning as many engineers already have SQL knowledge, it is clear that the most intuitive and lowest learning threshold search method is to use the user's native language - natural language.

Therefore, Karpor offers search by natural language feature for Kubernetes resources in Karpor.

Below are the steps to use Search by Natural Language:

1. **Enter the Search page**: Karpor designs the homepage as the entry point for search, so opening Karpor's Web UI immediately presents you with the search page. Then we can choose `Search By Natural Language`.

3. **Execute the query**ï¼šClick the 'search' button to execute the query and be sent to the search results page. Karpor will return a list of resources that match the natural language query.

5. **Second search**ï¼šKarpor's natural language query is converted to SQL, which the user can modify to start the search again.
