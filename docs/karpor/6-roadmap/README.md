title: Roadmap
---
Karpor is an emerging open-source project, and we are committed to diligently polishing it into a **small and beautiful, vendor-neutral, developer-friendly, community-driven** open-source project! üöÄ Moving forward, we will focus our efforts in the following areas:

- Refine Karpor's **usability** to lower the barrier of entry and make it sufficiently "user-friendly."
- Strengthen Karpor's **reliability** to ensure it is dependable in production environments.
- Deepen the **ecosystem integration** with more community tools to ensure openness.
- Explore **AI + Karpor** to create more possibilities.
- Embrace the open-source community; we love the **open-source spirit**. If you're interested in open source, then start here!
- ......

Karpor follows the [Release Process and Cadence Guide](../4-developer-guide/2-conventions/1-release-process.md), but actions may not strictly adhere to the roadmap. We may adjust milestones based on feedback from community meetings and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor/issues), expecting all community members to join the discussions. For final decisions, please refer to the [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor/milestones).

Below is the detailed roadmap, which we will continue to update ‚¨áÔ∏è
