# Use VS Code Kusion

The [VS Code Kusion extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KusionStack.kusion) provides convenient operations to deliver KCL configurations to Clouds.

## Before You Begin

You could begin with VS Code Kusion using cloud IDE [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), or you could install it on your desktop VS Code.

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="cloudide"
  values={[
    {label: 'GitHub Codespaces', value: 'cloudide'},
    {label: 'VS Code Desktop', value: 'desktop'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="cloudide">

Conguratulations! 🎉🎉 There's no environment setting up required! You could directly [create a workspace with bundled Kusion](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=488867056&machine=standardLinux32gb&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer.json).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="desktop">

**Step 1.** Install Kusion on your system. Please refer to [install kusion](/docs/user_docs/getting-started/install).

**Step 2.** Install the Kusion extension for Visual Studio Code. This extension requires the VS Code 1.68+.

**Step 3.** You need to have a Kubernetes Cluster and place the kubeConfig file at `~/.kube/config`.

## Get Started to Deliver Your First App

Here's an example for you to quickly get started to deliver [code city](https://wettel.github.io/codecity.html) application to the clouds with the VS Code Kusion Extension. All the steps could be interactivly experienced in the `Getting started with Kusion` walkthrough within VS Code.

To find the Kusion walkthrough: Open the Command Palatte > type and select `Welcome: Open Walkthrough...` > then type and select `kusion`.


### 1. Abstract: Define Your Models

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="cloudide"
  values={[
    {label: 'GitHub Codespaces', value: 'cloudide'},
    {label: 'VS Code Desktop', value: 'desktop'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="cloudide">

The monorepo [konfig](https://github.com/KusionStack/konfig) is already opened in your workspace. It contains classical atractions of application configuration for you to quick start.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="desktop">

You could clone the monorepo [konfig](https://github.com/KusionStack/konfig) which contains classical atractions of application configuration for you to quick start:
    
```shell
git clone https://github.com/KusionStack/konfig.git
```

Then open it with your VS Code.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Config: New Kusion Project

You could quickly create a new kusion project from archetype. To do that, click the `Create Kusion Project` button on the walkthrough (or, type `Kusion: Create` in the Command Palatte), and select a project template(For example using the `code-city` template you could deploy an application to visualize software as 3D cities).
