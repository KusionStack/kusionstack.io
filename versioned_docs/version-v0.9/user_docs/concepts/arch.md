![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KusionStack/kusion/main/docs/workflow.png)


KusionStack includes two core components:

- [Kusion](https://github.com/KusionStack/kusion): The engine to deliver intentions to Kubernetes and Clouds
- [Catalog](https://github.com/KusionStack/catalog): Catalog of shared Kusion Models and Generators.

The image above illustrates the workflow of KusionStack and how it works. In the next section, we will describe each of these components in detail.
