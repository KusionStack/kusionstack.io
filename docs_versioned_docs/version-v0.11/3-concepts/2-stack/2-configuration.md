# Stack Configuration

Users can add config items of the stack in `stack.yaml`, such as the stack name, etc.

Here is an example of `stack.yaml`.

```yaml
# The stack basic info
name: dev
```

The config items in `stack.yaml` are explained below.

- **name**: The name of the stack, should be same as the workspace name, such as `dev`, `pre` and `prod`.
