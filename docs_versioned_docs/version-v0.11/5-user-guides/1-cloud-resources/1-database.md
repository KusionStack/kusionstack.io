# Deliver the WordPress Application with Cloud RDS

This tutorial will demonstrate how to deploy a WordPress application with Kusion, which relies on both Kubernetes and IaaS resources provided by cloud vendors. We can learn how to declare the Relational Database Service (RDS) to provide a cloud-based database solution with Kusion for our application from this article. 

## Prerequisites

- Install [Kusion](../../2-getting-started/1-install-kusion.md). 
- Install [kubectl CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) and run a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) or [k3s](https://docs.k3s.io/quick-start) or [k3d](https://k3d.io/v5.4.4/#installation) or [MiniKube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node) cluster. 
- Prepare a cloud service account and create a user with at least **VPCFullAccess** and **RDSFullAccess** related permissions to use the Relational Database Service (RDS). This kind of user can be created and managed in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) console of the cloud vendor. 
- The environment that executes `kusion` needs to have connectivity to terraform registry to download the terraform providers. 

Additionally, we also need to configure the obtained AccessKey and SecretKey as well as the cloud resource region as environment variables for specific cloud provider:

<TabItem value="AWS" >

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIAQZDxxxx" # replace it with your AccessKey
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="oE/xxxx" # replace it with your SecretKey
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1            # replace it with your region
```

<TabItem value="Alicloud">
```

```bash
export ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY="LTAI5txxx" # replace it with your AccessKey
export ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY="nxuowIxxx" # replace it with your SecretKey
export ALICLOUD_REGION=cn-hangzhou     # replace it with your region
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Init Workspace

To deploy the WordPress application with cloud rds, we first need to initiate a `Workspace` for the targeted stack (here we are using `dev`). Please copy the following example YAML file to your local `workspace.yaml`. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="AWS" >

`workspace.yaml`
```yaml
# MySQL configurations for AWS RDS
modules: 
  kusionstack/mysql@0.1.0: 
    default: 
      cloud: aws
      size: 20
      instanceType: db.t3.micro
      privateRouting: false
      databaseName: "wordpress-mysql"
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Alicloud">
```

`workspace.yaml`
```yaml
# MySQL configurations for Alicloud RDS
modules: 
  kusionstack/mysql@0.1.0: 
    default: 
      cloud: alicloud
      size: 20
      instanceType: mysql.n2.serverless.1c
      category: serverless_basic
      privateRouting: false
      subnetID: [your-subnet-id]
      databaseName: "wordpress-mysql"
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

If you would like to try creating the `Alicloud` RDS instance, you should replace the `[your-subnet-id]` of `modules.kusionstack/mysql@0.1.0.default.subnetID` field with the Alicloud `vSwitchID` to which the database will be provisioned in. After that, you can execute the following command line to initiate the configuration for `dev` workspace. 

```shell
kusion workspace create dev -f workspace.yaml
```

Since Kusion by default use the `default` workspace, we can switch to the `dev` workspace with the following cmd: 

```shell
kusion workspace switch dev
```

If you have already created and used the configuration of `dev` workspace, you can append the MySQL module configs to your workspace YAML file and use the following command line to update the workspace configuration. 

```shell
kusion workspace update dev -f workspace.yaml
```

We can use the following command lines to show the current workspace configurations for `dev` workspace. 

```shell
kusion workspace show
```

The `workspace.yaml` is a sample configuration file for workspace management, including `MySQL` module configs. Workspace configurations are usually declared by **Platform Engineers** and will take effect through the corresponding stack. 

:::info
More details about the configuration of Workspace can be found in [Concepts of Workspace](../../3-concepts/4-workspace.md). 
:::

## Create Project And Stack

We can create a new project named `wordpress-rds-cloud` with the `kusion project create` command. 

```shell
# Create a new directory and navigate into it. 
mkdir wordpress-rds-cloud && cd wordpress-rds-cloud

# Create a new project with the name of the current directory. 
kusion project create
```

After creating the new project, we can create a new stack named `dev` with the `kusion stack create` command. 

```shell
# Create a new stack with the specified name under current project directory. 
kusion stack create dev
```

The created project and stack structure looks like below: 

```shell
tree
.
├── dev
│   ├── kcl.mod
│   ├── main.k
│   └── stack.yaml
└── project.yaml

2 directories, 4 files
```

### Update And Review Configuration Codes

The configuration codes in the created stack are basically empty, thus we should replace the `dev/kcl.mod` and `dev/main.k` with the below codes: 

```shell
# dev/kcl.mod
[dependencies]
kam = { git = "https://github.com/KusionStack/kam.git", tag = "0.1.0" }
network = { oci = "oci://ghcr.io/kusionstack/network", tag = "0.1.0" }
mysql = { oci = "oci://ghcr.io/kusionstack/mysql", tag = "0.1.0" }
```

```python
# dev/main.k 
import kam.v1.app_configuration as ac
import kam.v1.workload as wl
import kam.v1.workload.container as c
import network as n
import mysql

# main.k declares customized configurations for dev stacks.
wordpress: ac.AppConfiguration {
    workload: wl.Service {
        containers: {
            wordpress: c.Container {
                image: "wordpress:6.3"
                env: {
                    "WORDPRESS_DB_HOST": "$(KUSION_DB_HOST_WORDPRESS_MYSQL)"
                    "WORDPRESS_DB_USER": "$(KUSION_DB_USERNAME_WORDPRESS_MYSQL)"
                    "WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD": "$(KUSION_DB_PASSWORD_WORDPRESS_MYSQL)"
                    "WORDPRESS_DB_NAME": "mysql"
                }
                resources: {
                    "cpu": "500m"
                    "memory": "512Mi"
                }
            }
        }
        replicas: 1
    }
    accessories: {
        "network": n.Network {
            ports: [
              n.Port {
                  port: 80
              }
            ]
        }
        "mysql": mysql.MySQL {
            type: "cloud"
            version: "8.0"
        }
    }
}
```

## Application Delivery

You can complete the delivery of the WordPress application in the folder of `wordpress-cloud-rds/dev` using the following command line. Kusion will enable the watching of the application resource creation and automatic port-forwarding of the specified port (80) from local to the Kubernetes Service. 

```shell
cd dev && kusion apply --watch
```

:::info
During the first apply, the models and modules as well as the Terraform CLI (if not exists) that the application depends on will be downloaded, so it may take some time (usually within two minutes). You can take a break and have a cup of coffee.

```

After all the resources reconciled, we can port-forward our local port (e.g. 12345) to the WordPress frontend service port (80) in the cluster:

```shell
kubectl port-forward -n wordpress-cloud-rds svc/wordpress-cloud-rds-dev-wordpress-private 12345:80
```

## Verify WordPress Application

Next, we will verify the WordPress site service we just delivered, along with the creation of the RDS instance it depends on. We can start using the WordPress site by accessing the link of local-forwarded port [(http://localhost:12345)](http://localhost:12345) we just configured in the browser. 

![wordpress site page](/img/docs/user_docs/getting-started/wordpress-site-page.png)

In addition, we can also log in to the cloud service console page to view the RDS instance we just created.

## Delete WordPress Application

You can delete the WordPress application and related RDS resources using the following command line. 

```shell
kusion destroy --yes
