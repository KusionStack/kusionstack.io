| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|**failureThreshold**|int|Minimum consecutive failures for the probe to be considered failed after having succeeded.||
|**initialDelaySeconds**|int|The number of seconds before health checking is activated.<br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes||
|**periodSeconds**|int|How often (in seconds) to perform the probe.||
|**probeHandler** `required`|[Exec](#exec) | [Http](#http) | [Tcp](#tcp)|The action taken to determine the alive or health of a container||
|**successThreshold**|int|Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed.||
|**terminationGracePeriod**|int|Duration in seconds before terminate gracefully upon probe failure.||
|**timeoutSeconds**|int|The number of seconds after which the probe times out.<br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes||

### Examples
```python
import kam.workload.container.probe as p

probe = p.Probe {
    probeHandler: p.Http {
        path: "/healthz"

    initialDelaySeconds: 10
}
```
