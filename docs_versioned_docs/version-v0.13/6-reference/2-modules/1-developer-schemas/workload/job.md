## Schema Job

Job is a kind of workload profile that describes how to run your application code. This<br />is typically used for tasks that take from a few seconds to a few days to complete.

### Attributes

| name | type | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|**annotations**|{str:str}|Annotations are key/value pairs that attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to the workload.||
|**containers** `required`|{str:[Container](../internal/container#schema-container)}|Containers defines the templates of containers to be ran.<br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers||
|**labels**|{str:str}|Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to the workload.||
|**replicas**|int|Number of container replicas based on this configuration that should be ran.||
|**schedule** `required`|str|The scheduling strategy in Cron format. More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron.||
|**secrets**|{str:[Secret](../internal/secret/secret.md#schema-secret)}|Secrets can be used to store small amount of sensitive data e.g. password, token.||

### Examples
```python
# Instantiate a job with busybox image and runs every hour

import kam.workload as wl
import kam.workload.container as c

echoJob : wl.Job {
    containers: {
        "busybox": c.Container{
            image:   "busybox:1.28"

    schedule: "0 * * * *"
}
```

### Base Schema

Container describes how the Application's tasks are expected to be run. Depending on<br />the replicas parameter 1 or more containers can be created from each template.
