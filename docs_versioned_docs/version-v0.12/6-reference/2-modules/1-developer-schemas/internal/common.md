## Schema WorkloadBase

WorkloadBase defines set of attributes shared by different workload profile, e.g Service<br />and Job. You can inherit this Schema to reuse these common attributes.

### Attributes

|**annotations**|{str:str}|Annotations are key/value pairs that attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to the workload.||
|**containers** `required`|{str:}|Containers defines the templates of containers to be ran.<br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers||
|**labels**|{str:str}|Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to the workload.||
|**replicas**|int|Number of container replicas based on this configuration that should be ran.||
|**secrets**|{str:[s.Secret](#schema-secret)}|Secrets can be used to store small amount of sensitive data e.g. password, token.||
