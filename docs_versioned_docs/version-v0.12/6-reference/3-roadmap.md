# Roadmap

For a finer-grained view of our roadmap and what is being worked on for a release, please refer to the [Roadmap](https://github.com/KusionStack/kusion/issues)

## Expand Kusion Module Ecosystem to meet more scenarios

We plan to expand the range of Kusion modules. This includes not only cloud services but also popular cloud-native projects such as Prometheus, Backstage, Crossplane, etc. By leveraging the ecosystem of CNCF projects and Terraform providers, we aim to enrich the Kusion module ecosystem to meet more scenarios.

## LLM (Large Language Models) Operation

Kusion is essentially designed to tackle team collaboration challenges. The LLM operations also involve many collaborative tasks. We believe Kusion can boost the operational efficiency of LLM engineers in this setting as well.

## Kusion Server

Currently, Kusion is a command-line tool, which has its pros and cons. Through our discussions with community users, we‘ve discovered that some of them prefer a long-running service with a web portal. We’re planning to build this form of Kusion, and have already started developing some features.
