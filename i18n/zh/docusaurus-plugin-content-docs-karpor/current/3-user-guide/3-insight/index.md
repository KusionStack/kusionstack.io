title: How to Insight
---

In this section, we will introduce how to gain comprehensive insights into the resources within a cluster using Karpor. You can access the Insight page in various ways and easily toggle between insight pages for different scopes (such as Cluster, Kind, Namespace or individual Resource). If there are domain-specific logical scopes within your current organization, you can even customize resource groups (such as Application, Environment, etc.) by setting resource group rules. We also provide functionality to gain insights into these custom resource groups.

This guide will be entirely operated from the Karpor Dashboard.
