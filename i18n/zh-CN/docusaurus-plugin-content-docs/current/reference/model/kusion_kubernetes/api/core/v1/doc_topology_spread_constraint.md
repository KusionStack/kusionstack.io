## Schema TopologySpreadConstraint

TopologySpreadConstraint specifies how to spread matching pods among the given topology.

### Attributes

|Name and Description|Type|Default Value|Required|
|--------------------|----|-------------|--------|
|**maxSkew**<br />     MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 1/1/0: &#124; zone1 &#124; zone2 &#124; zone3 &#124; &#124;   P   &#124;   P   &#124;       &#124; - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 1/1/1; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(2-0) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.<br />topologyKey : str, default is Undefined, required<br />     TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each \<key, value\> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. It's a required field.<br />whenUnsatisfiable : str, default is Undefined, required<br />     WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,|int|Undefined|**required**|
