## Schema HTTPIngressPath

HTTPIngressPath associates a path with a backend. Incoming urls matching the path are forwarded to the backend.

### Attributes

|Name and Description|Type|Default Value|Required|
|--------------------|----|-------------|--------|
|**path**<br />      Path is matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional "path" part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a '/' and must be present when using PathType with value "Exact" or "Prefix".<br /> pathType : str, default is Undefined, required<br />      PathType determines the interpretation of the Path matching. PathType can be one of the following values: \* Exact: Matches the URL path exactly. \* Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is<br />done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the<br />list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a<br />match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the<br />request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring<br />of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar<br />matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).|str|Undefined|optional|
|**pathType**|str|Undefined|**required**|
